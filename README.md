# OpenNature
> Free open information (CC0) about nature on planet earth.

We believe that data about our natural world should be open to the general public, not only for a selection of scientists or use-cases (which is the case at Macaulay Library and others).<br>
This library aims to provide free to use information about all living species, starting with <strong>a royalty free image of each bird species</strong>.
